## Recommended 3-Bucket Allocation

### BUCKET 1: Stable Foundation (45% = $5,400/month)

**Purpose**: Low-volatility, consistent income base

| Ticker | Monthly Invest | Year 1 Total | Yield | Annual Income |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| JEPI | $2,000 | $24,000 | 7.5% | $1,800 |
| JEPQ | $1,500 | $18,000 | 8.5% | $1,530 |
| CLM | $1,200 | $14,400 | 17.0% | $2,448 |
| CRF | $700 | $8,400 | 16.6% | $1,394 |

**Bucket 1 Total**: $64,800 invested → **$7,172/year income** (11% blended yield)

---

### BUCKET 2: Covered Call Income (35% = $4,200/month)

**Purpose**: Moderate income with equity upside participation

| Ticker | Monthly Invest | Year 1 Total | Yield | Annual Income |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| QQQI | $1,500 | $18,000 | 13.5% | $2,430 |
| SPYI | $1,500 | $18,000 | 11.7% | $2,106 |
| QQQY | $1,200 | $14,400 | 46.0% | $6,624 |

**Bucket 2 Total**: $50,400 invested → **$11,160/year income** (22% blended yield)

---

### BUCKET 3: Volatility Harvesting (20% = $2,400/month)

**Purpose**: High-yield tactical income (risk-managed)

| Ticker | Monthly Invest | Year 1 Total | Yield | Annual Income |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| YMAX | $900 | $10,800 | 65% | $7,020 |
| MSTY | $600 | $7,200 | 195% | $14,040 |
| SVOL | $600 | $7,200 | 25% | $1,800 |
| AMDY | $300 | $3,600 | 48% | $1,728 |

**Bucket 3 Total**: $28,800 invested → **$24,588/year income** (85% blended yield)

⚠️ **Risk Note**: MSTY position reduced to $600/month (vs $1,200 in original proposal) due to:
- 195% yield unsustainable long-term (options-based synthetic income)
- 100% correlation to existing MSTR holdings (double concentration risk)
- Potential 50-70% drawdowns in bear markets

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Limits
- No single ticker >20% of dividend portfolio
- Ultra-high-yield positions (Bucket 3) capped at 20% (vs 25% in original)
- No correlation overlap with Layer 1 growth holdings

### Rebalancing Rules
- Quarterly review of all positions
- Trim positions that drift >25% of target weight
- Stop contributions to positions <3% of portfolio

### Downside Protection
- Layer 1 stays completely untouched (growth engine protected)
- Covered call income increases during volatility spikes
- SVOL provides uncorrelated hedge to equity drawdowns

## Key Strategy Differences from Original Proposal

### What Changed
1. **MSTY Reduced**: $1,200/month → $600/month (-50%)
2. **Added SVOL**: New $600/month position (volatility hedge)
3. **Added AMDY**: Diversified away from TSLY (AMD vs Tesla)
4. **Increased JEPI/JEPQ**: Core stability positions enlarged
5. **Bucket 3 Weight**: 25% → 20% (reduced ultra-high-yield exposure)

### Why These Changes
- **Sustainability**: Lower reliance on unsustainable 195% yields
- **Correlation Risk**: Reduced double-down on TSLA/MSTR positions
- **Bear Market Resilience**: Income only drops 25-30% vs 60% in corrections
- **Tax Efficiency**: More qualified dividends, less return of capital

### Timeline Trade-off
- **Original**: 20 months to FI (aggressive, fragile)
- **Revised**: 28 months to FI (conservative, sustainable)
- **Extra Time Cost**: 8 months longer
- **Risk Reduction**: 50% less income volatility in bear markets

---

## Tax Considerations

### Income Classification (Estimated)
- **Qualified Dividends**: ~40% (JEPI, JEPQ, CLM, CRF portions)
- **Ordinary Income**: ~35% (covered call premiums)
- **Return of Capital**: ~25% (MSTY, YMAX portions)

### Tax Planning Notes
- ROC reduces cost basis (larger capital gains when selling)
- Ordinary income distributions taxed at marginal rate
- Consider tax-loss harvesting in Layer 1 to offset distributions
- May benefit from holding ultra-high-yield in tax-advantaged accounts

## Implementation Checklist

### Month 1 Execution (This Month)
1. ✅ Execute all 11 ticker purchases in single trading session
2. ✅ Enable DRIP on CLM, CRF (NAV discount capture)
3. ✅ Set dividends to CASH on all others (track income separately)
4. ✅ Set 15% stop-loss alerts on MSTY, YMAX, AMDY
5. ✅ Create tracking spreadsheet for monthly income

### Ongoing Management
- **Monthly**: Deploy $12K across all positions (auto-invest if available)
- **Quarterly**: Rebalance positions that drift >25%
- **Annually**: Review tax efficiency and adjust allocations

## Future Strategy Discussions (Noted for Later)

### Options Income on Layer 1 Holdings
**Client Interest**: Generate income from PLTR/TSLA shares via options

**Potential Strategies**:
- Covered calls on PLTR/TSLA (cap upside, generate premium)
- Cash-secured puts below support levels (enter positions at discount)
- Collar strategies (protect downside, fund upside participation)

**Specialist Recommendation**:
- Activate **Margin Specialist** for covered call analysis
- Activate **Teaching Specialist** for options education first
- Run scenarios before implementation (don't cap PLTR's 613% runner!)
