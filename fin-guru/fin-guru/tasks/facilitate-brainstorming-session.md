# Facilitate Finance Strategy Brainstorming Session

Guide wealth strategy ideation workshops focused on Finance Guru specializations (margin, dividend, cash-flow, quantitative overlays).

## Step 1: Session Intake

Ask exactly four questions without previewing later steps:

1. What financial decision or strategy are we brainstorming (portfolio overhaul, margin plan, dividend ladder, etc.)?
2. What constraints or policies must we respect (risk tolerance, margin buffer, compliance rules, tax jurisdiction)?
3. Is the goal broad exploration or converging on a short list of executable strategies?
4. Should I capture outcomes in a structured document for follow-up (default **Yes**) and where should it be saved?

## Step 2: Offer Facilitation Modes

After gathering context, present numbered options:

1. Client chooses techniques from Finance Guru brainstorming library
2. Orchestrator recommends techniques aligned to stated goal/risk profile
3. Randomized mix for creative cross-pollination
4. Progressive flow (divergent → quant validation → implementation planning)

## Step 3: Execute Selected Techniques

Principles:

- You are a facilitator; prompt the client to generate ideas, highlight trade-offs, and reference Finance Guru frameworks.
- Maintain engagement until the user asks to switch or proceed.
- Log insights immediately if document output requested.

### Technique Library (examples)

Use methods stored in `research/finance/financial-strategies/` and Finance Guru knowledge base:

- **Market Pulse Scan** – surface macro/sector themes influencing strategy
- **Risk Laddering** – map strategies by volatility, drawdown, liquidity
- **Margin Scenario Lab** – evaluate leverage ideas under stress cases
- **Dividend Sustainability Drill** – vet income ideas via coverage metrics
- **Cash-Flow Alignment Canvas** – synchronize inflows/outflows with buffers
- **Tax Optimization Matrix** – compare account placement, harvesting options
- **Implementation Milestone Mapping** – plan monitoring triggers and checkpoints

For each technique:

1. Describe the objective and required inputs (e.g., current margin rate, desired payout).
2. Pose guiding questions referencing Finance Guru analysis phases.
3. Capture user-generated ideas, risks, and required data.
4. Ask whether to deepen the same technique, switch, or move to convergence.

## Step 4: Session Flow

1. **Warm-up** – quick review of objectives, risk guardrails, compliance reminders
2. **Divergent Exploration** – generate strategy options without judgement
3. **Quant Validation** – pressure-test best ideas using risk framework (VaR, stress, buffers)
4. **Implementation Planning** – outline action steps, monitoring cadence, artifact needs

## Step 5: Documentation (if requested)

Create a session report with sections:

- **Executive Summary** – topic, goals, compliance reminder
- **Techniques Used** – list, duration, rationale
- **Idea Bank** – categorized into immediate plays, research queue, moonshots
- **Risk & Compliance Notes** – margin buffers, concentration warnings, disclaimers
- **Next Actions** – prioritized steps, owners (or agents), required artifacts (models, reports)
- **Open Questions** – data gaps, approvals, dependency checks

## Facilitation Guardrails

- Reinforce educational purpose and encourage consultation with licensed advisors.
- Surface compliance or risk conflicts immediately (e.g., leverage beyond policy).
- Encourage citing data sources or requesting follow-up research tasks.
- Use warm, professional tone; celebrate client contributions and summarize frequently.
- End by confirming whether to hand off to specialist agents (quant analysis, strategy advisor, compliance) for deeper work.
