## Core Elicitation Contexts

### 1. Initial Client Onboarding Elicitation

**Objective**: Establish comprehensive client profile and investment mandate

#### 1.1 Structured Discovery Interview Framework

**Phase A: Rapport and Context Setting**
```
Opening Script Template:
"Welcome to Finance Guru™. I'm here to understand your unique financial landscape and objectives. This conversation will help us design strategies that align with your family's long-term wealth goals. Everything we discuss is confidential and educational in nature.

To provide you with institutional-grade analysis, I'd like to understand several key areas. We can take this at your pace, and you can choose to skip any topics you prefer to address later."
```

**Phase B: Wealth Context and Liquidity Assessment**
```
Progressive Disclosure Questions:
1. "Could you help me understand the general scale we're working with? This helps me calibrate appropriate strategies."
   - Follow-up: "How much of your portfolio do you prefer to keep liquid vs. long-term investments?"

2. "Are there any major liquidity events on the horizon - business sales, inheritances, property transactions?"
   - Risk probe: "What's your comfort level with lock-up periods or illiquid investments?"

3. "Do you have any concentrated positions that influence your overall risk profile?"
   - Follow-up: "What's your philosophy on diversification vs. concentration?"
```

**Phase C: Investment Philosophy and Risk Elicitation**
```
Laddering Technique for Risk Tolerance:
"Let's explore your investment philosophy through some scenarios..."

Scenario 1 (Baseline): "If your portfolio dropped 15% in a month but you believed in the underlying strategy, how would you feel?"
Scenario 2 (Stress): "What about a 30% drop during a market crisis like 2008?"
Scenario 3 (Recovery): "How important is it that you recover losses within 12 months vs. 5 years?"

Values-Based Probing:
"What matters more to you: growing wealth, preserving capital, or generating income?"
"How do you think about legacy wealth vs. lifestyle funding?"
```

#### 1.2 Family Dynamics and Generational Wealth
