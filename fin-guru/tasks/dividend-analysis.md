- **Coverage Ratio Trends**: Multi-year payout ratio progression and sustainability
- **Earnings Quality**: Recurring vs. non-recurring earnings, accounting quality assessment
- **Peer Comparison**: Payout ratios vs. industry peers and historical norms

**Analytical Framework**:
```
1. Payout Ratio Calculations:
   Trailing 12-Month Payout Ratio = (Dividends per Share TTM) / (EPS TTM)
   Forward Payout Ratio = (Current Dividend Rate) / (Forward EPS Estimate)
   5-Year Average Payout Ratio = Average of annual payout ratios

2. Coverage Analysis:
   Coverage Ratio = 1 / Payout Ratio
   Sustainable Coverage Range: 1.5x - 3.0x (varies by industry)
   Warning Zone: Coverage < 1.2x
   Danger Zone: Coverage < 1.0x

3. Earnings Quality Assessment:

```
1. Free Cash Flow Coverage:
   FCF Coverage = (Free Cash Flow TTM) / (Total Dividends Paid TTM)
   Target Coverage: >1.5x for stable industries, >2.0x for cyclical

   Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
   Adjusted FCF = FCF + Maintenance Capex - Growth Capex (if separable)

2. Capital Allocation Analysis:

- **Interest Coverage**: Ability to service debt obligations alongside dividends
- **Financial Flexibility**: Capacity for dividend maintenance during stress scenarios

**Analytical Protocol**:
```
1. Debt Analysis:
   Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity
   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents
   Debt-to-EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA (TTM)

   Target Ratios (vary by industry):
   - Utilities: Debt/Equity <1.0, Debt/EBITDA <4.0x
   - REITs: Debt/Equity <1.5, Debt/EBITDA <7.0x
   - Consumer Staples: Debt/Equity <0.5, Debt/EBITDA <3.0x

2. Liquidity Assessment:
   Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
   Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities
   Available Credit = Undrawn Credit Facilities + Cash

3. Interest Coverage Analysis:
   Interest Coverage = EBITDA / Interest Expense
   Fixed Charge Coverage = (EBITDA + Lease Payments) / (Interest + Lease Payments)
   Target Coverage: >4.0x for investment grade, >2.5x minimum
```

**Quality Checkpoints**:
- [ ] Debt levels and structure thoroughly analyzed
