## Individual Analysis Techniques

### 1. Financial Mind Mapping

**Purpose**: Visual exploration of investment opportunities, risk factors, and strategic connections.

**Process**:
1. **Central Theme**: Place the investment thesis or client objective at center
2. **Primary Branches**: Create main categories (Asset Classes, Geographies, Time Horizons, Risk Factors)
3. **Secondary Branches**: Add specific opportunities, concerns, or considerations
4. **Connections**: Draw relationships between different branches
5. **Analysis Layer**: Add quantitative data, ratios, and metrics to each node

**Financial Example - Portfolio Diversification**:
```
Central Node: "High Net Worth Client Portfolio"
├── Asset Classes
│   ├── Equities (60%)
│   │   ├── US Large Cap (25%)
│   │   ├── International Developed (20%)
│   │   └── Emerging Markets (15%)
│   ├── Fixed Income (30%)
│   │   ├── Government Bonds (15%)
│   │   └── Corporate Credit (15%)
│   └── Alternatives (10%)
│       ├── Real Estate (5%)
│       └── Private Equity (5%)
├── Risk Considerations
│   ├── Market Risk
│   ├── Liquidity Risk
│   └── Concentration Risk
└── Client Constraints
    ├── Tax Sensitivity
    ├── Liquidity Needs
    └── ESG Preferences
```

**Integration**: Use with Orchestrator Agent for initial strategy development and Quant Analyst for data validation.

### 2. SWOT Analysis for Investment Opportunities

**Purpose**: Systematic evaluation of investment opportunities or market conditions.

**Framework**:
- **Strengths**: Internal positive factors
- **Weaknesses**: Internal limiting factors
- **Opportunities**: External positive factors
- **Threats**: External risk factors

**Investment Example - Technology Sector Allocation**:

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Strong earnings growth | High valuations |
| Innovation leadership | Regulatory uncertainty |
| Market dominance | Concentration risk |

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
|------------------|-------------|
| AI/ML adoption | Interest rate sensitivity |
| Digital transformation | Antitrust actions |
| Emerging markets expansion | Geopolitical tensions |

**Process**:
1. Define the investment scope (sector, security, strategy)
2. Populate each quadrant with 5-7 relevant factors
3. Weight factors by importance and probability
4. Develop action items for each quadrant
5. Create monitoring framework

**Integration**: Collaborate with Compliance Officer for regulatory factors and Risk Analyst for threat assessment.

### 3. Scenario Planning Matrix

**Purpose**: Explore multiple market conditions and their portfolio implications.

**Structure**:
- **Base Case** (50% probability): Most likely scenario
- **Bull Case** (25% probability): Optimistic conditions
- **Bear Case** (25% probability): Stress scenario

**Framework Template**:
```
Scenario: Economic Recovery Post-Recession
├── Assumptions
│   ├── GDP Growth: 3.5% annually
│   ├── Inflation: 2.5% target
│   └── Interest Rates: Gradual normalization
├── Asset Class Performance
│   ├── Equities: +12% annually
│   ├── Bonds: +4% annually
│   └── Alternatives: +8% annually
├── Portfolio Implications

## Collaborative Strategy Methods

### 4. Six Thinking Hats for Investment Decisions

**Purpose**: Systematic exploration of investment decisions from multiple perspectives.

**Hat Assignments**:
- **White Hat** (Facts): Data, statistics, historical performance
- **Red Hat** (Emotions): Gut feelings, client sentiment, market psychology
- **Black Hat** (Caution): Risks, downsides, what could go wrong

2. **Generate Failure Modes**: List ways the strategy could fail
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand why each failure could occur
4. **Probability Assessment**: Estimate likelihood of each scenario
5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop preventive measures
6. **Monitoring Systems**: Create early warning indicators

**Example - High-Yield Bond Portfolio**:

**Failure Modes**:

- Concentration in cyclical industries
- Currency risk in international holdings

**Mitigation Framework**:
```
Risk: Credit Crisis
├── Early Indicators
│   ├── Credit spread widening
│   ├── High-yield issuance decline
│   └── Default rate acceleration
├── Preventive Measures

## Risk Assessment Ideation

### 8. Pre-Mortem Analysis

**Purpose**: Anticipate investment failures before they occur by imagining future failure scenarios.

**Process**:
1. **Future State**: Assume the investment strategy has failed
2. **Failure Narrative**: Write detailed stories of how failure occurred
3. **Root Cause Identification**: Trace back to original decisions
4. **Probability Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood of each scenario
5. **Prevention Planning**: Develop strategies to avoid identified pitfalls
6. **Monitoring Framework**: Create early warning systems

**Template Structure**:
```
Investment Strategy: Emerging Markets Equity Fund
Failure Date: 18 months from now
Failure Description: Fund down 40% versus benchmark

Failure Narrative:
"The fund's concentration in technology stocks proved disastrous when
China implemented strict data regulations. Simultaneously, rising US
interest rates triggered capital flight from emerging markets. The
fund's leverage amplified losses, and redemption pressure forced
sales at the worst possible time."

Root Causes:
1. Excessive concentration in single sector (tech)
2. Inadequate hedging of currency exposure
3. Insufficient liquidity planning for redemptions
4. Overleveraging in volatile markets
5. Failure to monitor regulatory risks

Prevention Measures:
1. Implement sector concentration limits (max 25%)
2. Currency hedge 50% of non-dollar exposure
3. Maintain 10% cash buffer for redemptions
4. Reduce leverage during volatile periods
5. Create regulatory risk monitoring system
```

### 9. Fault Tree Analysis for Portfolio Risk

**Purpose**: Systematically map how individual risks can cascade into portfolio-level failures.

**Structure**: Top-down analysis starting with undesirable outcome and working down to root causes.

**Example - Portfolio Liquidity Crisis**:
```
Portfolio Liquidity Crisis (Top Event)
├── AND Gate: Multiple Simultaneous Stresses
│   ├── Large Client Redemption
│   │   ├── Client Financial Distress
│   │   ├── Performance Dissatisfaction
│   │   └── Strategy Change
│   ├── Market Liquidity Evaporation
│   │   ├── Credit Market Stress
│   │   ├── Volatility Spike
│   │   └── Risk-Off Environment
│   └── Portfolio Concentration Issues
│       ├── Illiquid Asset Overweight
│       ├── Large Position Sizes
│       └── Limited Diversification
```

**Risk Mitigation by Node**:
- **Client Redemption**: Diversify client base, regular communication, performance monitoring
- **Market Liquidity**: Maintain cash buffer, ladder maturities, stress test positions
- **Concentration**: Position size limits, liquidity classifications, rebalancing protocols
