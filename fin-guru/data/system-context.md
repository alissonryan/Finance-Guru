## 📊 Your Google Sheets Portfolio Tracker

**Spreadsheet ID**: `1HtHRP3CbnOePb8RQ0RwzFYOQxk0uWC6L8ZMJeQYfWk4`
**URL**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HtHRP3CbnOePb8RQ0RwzFYOQxk0uWC6L8ZMJeQYfWk4/edit

This is YOUR live portfolio tracking spreadsheet with 6 tabs:
- **DataHub** - Master holdings with prices, gains/losses, layer classification
- **Dividend Tracker** - Monthly dividend income monitoring and DRIP status
- **Margin Dashboard** - Margin usage, interest costs, coverage ratios, scaling alerts
- **Cash Flow Monitor** - Deposits, withdrawals, cash movements
- **Weekly Review** - Performance summaries (future: auto-generated)
- **Bitcoin Enhanced Growth - Friend** - Special tracking (external data)

**Architecture Documentation**:
- 📖 **Full Guide**: `fin-guru/data/spreadsheet-architecture.md` - Complete rules, workflows, safety guardrails
- ⚡ **Quick Reference**: `fin-guru/data/spreadsheet-quick-ref.md` - Agent permission matrix and pre-flight checklist

**Key Principles for Agents**:
- **Data Source**: Fidelity CSV exports (`notebooks/updates/`) are authoritative for ticker, quantity, and avg cost basis
- **Price Data**: Google Finance formulas in Column C auto-update prices - DO NOT TOUCH
- **DataHub**: WRITABLE columns = A (Ticker), B (Quantity), G (Avg Cost Basis) from CSV - all others are formula-maintained
- **Agent Permissions**: Quant = read-only, Builder = write-enabled, specialists have tab-specific access
- **Safety Gates**: Stop on position mismatches, large changes (>10%), cost basis changes (>20%), formula errors (3+), margin jumps (>$5k)
- **Formula Protection**: Never modify working formulas - only repair broken ones with IFERROR wrappers
- **Layer Classification**: Pattern-based auto-assignment (dividend funds → Layer 2, growth → Layer 1, hedges → Layer 3)
- **Alpha Vantage**: Columns F, N-P use market data API (partially working) - troubleshooting in progress
